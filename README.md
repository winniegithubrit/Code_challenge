# YOUR README DESCRIPTION STARTS HERE
STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR:
About the program:
This is a simple javascript program that prompts the user to put the marks that the student has gotten
and then prints out the grade of the student as the output.


Instructions on how to go through with creating the program;

To begin with fork the assignment and create a new respository on your github account
then understand the program;
this program is simply telling us to propmt the user to give us a grade whenever we place a student marks

the process of creating the program is:
first prompt the user by using the prompt("")

declare the variables :speedlimit and demerit points
after that use if,else conditions to navigate through the code,put the output expected,go live,input the speed and then click on points.

this program is written strictly using the JavaScript programming language;



NET SALARY CALCULATOR (TOY PROBLEM);
About the program:
